# Computer Engineering - Thesis Project

**Title**: “Code-Reuse Exploits detection using the Intel Processor Trace technology”

**Description**: This project pretends, making use of the IntelPT technology, develop a mechanism to detect different kinds of Code-Reuse exploits (ie: ret2libc, ROP, JOP, etc.) at runtime, based on the Control Flow Integrity mitigation (aka. CFI).

**Credits**: This project make use of the following projects:
* [WindowsIntelPT Driver](https://github.com/intelpt/WindowsIntelPT)
* [Libipt - Intel(R) Processor Trace decoder library](https://github.com/01org/processor-trace)
* [Keystone assembler framework](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone)
